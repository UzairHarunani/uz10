      <ul>
        <li class="list"><b>Reduce, reuse, and recycle.</b> Reduce the amount of waste you produce. To preserve landfill space and natural resources, adhere to the three "R's".</li>
        <li class="list"><b>Volunteer.</b> Participate in community cleanups as a volunteer. You too can become involved in the preservation of your watershed.
        </li>
        <li class="list"><b>Educate.</b> By pursuing higher education, you can assist others in realizing the significance and worth of our natural resources.
        </li>
        <li class="list"><b>Conserve water.</b> Less runoff and wastewater eventually find their way into the ocean the less water you use.
        </li>
        <li class="list"><b>Choose sustainable.</b> Learn how to make smart seafood choices.
        </li>
        <li class="list"><b>Shop wisely.</b> Buy less plastic and bring a reusable shopping bag.
        </li>
        <li class="list"><b>Use long-lasting light bulbs.</b> Lightbulbs with higher energy efficiency emit fewer greenhouse gases. When you exit the area, remember that you switch off the lights as well!
        </li>
        <li class="list"><b>Plant a tree.</b> Oxygen and food are given by trees. They aid in reducing energy use, purifying the air, and halting climate change.
        </li>
        <li class="list"><b>Don't send chemicals into our waterways.</b> Choose non-toxic chemicals in the home and office.
        </li>
        <li class="list"><b>Bike more.</b> Driving causes air pollution, which is bad for the Earth.
        </li>
      </ul>
